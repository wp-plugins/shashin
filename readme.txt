Shashin is a powerful WordPress plugin that lets you display Picasa images anywhere in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Shashin has many features that enable you to display your Picasa photos in a variety of ways in your Wordpress posts and pages:

* Embed a gallery of your Picasa albums, and all the photos in each album.
* Show your photos with Highslide.
* Pick individual photos to display, in any size supported by Picasa.
* Pick photos from any combination of albums to display in groups of thumbnails.
* Show thumbnails of your newest photos, from one or more albums.
* Display album thumbnails for albums you choose, or all your albums, sorted however you like. Includes links to Google Maps.
* Display any number of random photos, from one or more albums. You can also choose to exclude certain photos or albums from random display.
* Use widgets for all of the above!
* Customize the Shashin stylesheet to suit the theme of your site.

== Installation ==

**Installation**

Download the zip file, unzip it, and copy the "shashin" folder to your plugins directory. Then activate it from your plugin panel. After successful activation, Shashin will appear under your "Manage" tab and under your "Options" tab.

Go to the "Options" tab first and take a look at the default options, which for many people will not require any changes. If your Picasa server is outside the US, then change the server (e.g. to picasaweb.google.co.uk).

Now go to the "Manage" tab and follow the directions to add your first album!

Note that Shashin will add two tables to your WordPress database, named wp\_shashin\_album and wp\_shashin\_photo. **You should include these tables when making backups of your WordPress tables.**

**Special Note to Upgraders:** Deactivate your old installation, upload the new version, and then reactivate. This is necessary for required updates to the Shashin tables.

**Special Note for WordPress installations that are in a subdirectory:** For the most part Shashin is smart about detecting the location of files, but if your WordPress installation is in a subdirectory of your web site, you will need to edit the 5 URL paths listed in shashin/display/highslide.css to correctly reflect the location of your WordPress installation.
