**First-Time Installation Instructions**

1. Go to the Shashin Settings menu and adjust the options as you like. It's important that you provide the correct URL for your Picasa server. For example, if you're in the UK, it would be http://picasaweb.google.co.uk

1. Note that Shashin will add two tables to your WordPress database, named wp\_shashin\_album and wp\_shashin\_photo. **It's important to include these tables when making backups of your WordPress tables.** The Shashin tags rely on key numbers from these tables that you won't get back if you lose the data in these tables.
