Shashin is a powerful WordPress plugin that lets you display Picasa images anywhere in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Shashin has many features that enable you to display your Picasa photos in a variety of ways in your Wordpress posts and pages:

* Embed a gallery of your Picasa albums, and all the photos in each album.
* Show your photos with Highslide slideshows.
* Pick individual photos to display, in any size supported by Picasa.
* Pick photos from any combination of albums to display in groups of thumbnails.
* Show thumbnails of your newest photos, from one or more albums.
* Display album thumbnails for albums you choose, or all your albums, sorted however you like. Includes links to Google Maps.
* Display any number of random photos, from one or more albums. You can also choose to exclude certain photos or albums from random display.
* Use widgets for all of the above!
* Customize the Shashin and Highslide stylesheets to suit the theme of your site.

New features in Shashin 2.2:

* Includes the latest version of Highslide, and automatically uses its new slideshow feature when viewing groups of photos.
* Shows videos in Highslide.
* Includes new options in the Settings menu for autoplaying Highslide slideshows, how long to display each slideshow image, and the dimensions for displaying videos.
* Checks for shashin.css and highslide.css in your active theme directory - this allows you to customize the stylesheets without worrying about losing your customizations the next time you upgrade Shashin.
* No longer necessary to update image paths in highslide.css if you have WordPress installed in a subdirectory on your site.
* For the caption in Shashin's tags, in addition to "y" or "n" you can now use "c", which means all pictures will get the caption "Click picture to enlarge" and all videos will get the caption "Click picture to play video." The actual caption will be displayed in the Highslide window.
* Option to make thumbnails not clickable, if you don't want to display a larger version.

== Installation ==

**Installation**

Download the zip file, unzip it, and copy the "shashin" folder to your plugins directory. Then activate it from your plugin panel. After successful activation, Shashin will appear under your "Manage" tab and under your "Settings" tab.

Go to the "Settings" tab first and take a look at the default options, which for many people will not require any changes. If your Picasa server is outside the US, then change the server (for example, if you're in the UK, it would be picasaweb.google.co.uk).

Now go to the "Manage" tab and follow the directions to add your first album!

Note that Shashin will add two tables to your WordPress database, named wp\_shashin\_album and wp\_shashin\_photo. **You should include these tables when making backups of your WordPress tables.**

**Special note to upgraders:** Deactivate your old installation, upload the new version, and then reactivate. This is necessary for required updates to the Shashin tables. Also, **you need to sync all your albums** - click the "Sync All" button (under the "Manage" tab).
