ShashinAlbum::getAlbumPhotos - sets timestamp to 0 if photo doesn't have one (fix for mySQL error under Windows)

I have a lot planned for Shashin 2.5:

<ul>
<li>Buttons for both the HTML and Visual Editors!</li>
<li>Easier to use <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API">shortcode</a> syntax for Shashin's tags</li>
<li>A tag to support <a href="http://highslide.com/examples/gallery-thumbstrip-above.html">Highslide's new thumbstrip feature</a></li>
<li>Custom captions</li>
<li>Ability to group albums by Picasa username</li>
</ul>
